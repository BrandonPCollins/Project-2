# Project-2 - The Wizard's Tower

For our second project we were tasked with the creation of a web-page which interactive front-end capabilities in order to showcase a working grasp of HTML, CSS and Javascript all working in collusion with one another to deliver a dynamic experience for the user. To this end I created a basic "Choose Your Own Adventure" game, modelled on the Fighting Fantasy books written by Ian Livingston and Steve Jackson whic I adored during my formative years. 

The game operates in the vein of a classic Dungeon Crawler, prompting the player for the name and then giving them a choice of potential character classes. The chosen classes then allow for differing potential outcomes as they make their way up the 5 floors of the eponymous Wizard's Tower, facing trials and tribulations that may find them ending up as just anoter casuality of the notoriously deadly construction. To represent this upon their entrance to the tower, the player is provided with a health bar which they must preserve on their journey, or perish to the perils before them. As a short game the site exists to provide the same interactive experience which was available through the those books I adored, whether the player is a returning fan like myself, or experiencing them for the first time.

More importantly it served as a great learning experience for myself in building a functional and interactive javascript game.

## Features 

### Logo & Background 

Front and centre atop my website is the Wizard's Tower logo, immediately conveying to the user the site's identity. I designed the logo using the paint.net image editor, styling the text, applying the gradient and then placing the Wizard's hat stock image taken from [Vecteezy](https://www.vecteezy.com/vector-art/2514766-wizard-hat-piece). I tried to ensure everything about the logo presented a fantastical aesthetic, immediately connoting the kind of game the player was about to partake in.

Advised in my first project to make use of a colour pallette generator, so I made use of Adobe's Colour Palette generator when picking the shades of my gradient to ensure they would be complementary shades, using the RGB values when applying the colours in paint.net.

To compliment the Logo I went with the image of a starry sky taken from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/photo/stars-1257860/) which I cropped and manipulated to serve the purpose as a background. I wanted to reinforce the mystical and fantastical atmosphere of the game, and the common connnotation of wizards and star-gazing made this ideal as a background. Given more time I might have made a parralax background of the stars, but I deemed it superflouos to the main goal of the project and was thus not a high priority.

### Story Nodes 

Beneath the logo and centered within the screen is the div containing the dynamically updating story nodes pulled by the javascript. When the player first opens the page, the text will fade in, further heightening the mysticism inherit in the game, and then the player will be prompted to enter their name via a text box.

Instumenal in learning how to process through a Choose your Own Adventure game in Javascript was this video from Web Dev Simplified. I expanded upon what they have shown enough to clearly make the work my own, but without this video it would have taken me far longer to get my feet on the ground in this project.
